1. Explain how the config for this app works, and why when using docker compose might this be a good way to configure rather than a config file

    The Dockerfile is for configuring the container and setting up the container environment.

    All the web app config reside in the setting folder. The settings specified the applications
    and middlewares needed for the web service. They also include the environment variables
    for running the web services.

    Docker compose make configuration easier and faster when we work with multiple containers.



2. Explain why the startup_check.py file exists and what it does

    Setting up the backend of the web services. Locking, logging, authentication etc.

    Checking migrations to propagate to the Django models which will affect the database.



3. Explain what the entrypoint.sh file does

    Starting up the web services we implemented.

    Starting the startup_check.py script and starting Gunicorn service
    to run the Python web application
