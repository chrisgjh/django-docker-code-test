1. Explain how the config for this app works, and why when using docker compose might this be a good way to configure rather than a config file

    The application can be configured by environment variables, and because docker-compose
    lets you set those, you can configure the whole app through the docker compose file and
    not need any secondary config file. This makes your docker compose file the single 
    definition for your whole application.



2. Explain why the startup_check.py file exists and what it does

    Setting up the backend of the web services. Locking, logging, authentication etc.

    Checking migrations to propagate to the Django models which will affect the database.



3. Explain what the entrypoint.sh file does

    Starting up the web services we implemented.

    Starting the startup_check.py script and starting Gunicorn service
    to run the Python web application
